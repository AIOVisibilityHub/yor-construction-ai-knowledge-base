        <p>
            We design and build accessory dwelling units (ADUs) that add rental income and property value while staying fully compliant with current California legislation. 
            Since the passage of SB-13 in 2020, most California homeowners are no longer required to live on-site to add or rent out an ADU. 
            Our team navigates the local zoning rules, setback requirements, and utility connections so you can focus on how you’ll use the new space.
